> The Python part discussed in this course is very nice. I also noted very well. Django part is good to start but it is not production standard. It can be used just to understand the topics. Backend part is discussed, but the frontend style integration is not discussed well.

Repository (Mine): https://github.com/thehimel/pyblog
